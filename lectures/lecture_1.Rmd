# Data Analytics and Big Data

# What are Big Data?

### Definition

The term Big Data corresponds to a table containing observations (i.e. database or dataset) that is **too long, too large or too complex to be handled by conventional tools**

### Microsoft Excel's Limits (v16.77 - Office 365):

- Total number of rows: **1,048,576 rows**
- Total number columns: **16,384 columns**

# Data vs. Information

Without data, an organization could not successfully complete most business activities. However, organisations need to convert these data into meaningful information

- Data consists of raw facts
- Information is often confused with the term data

### Example: Sales Manager
- Knowing number of sales for each representative (fact – data)
- Knowing total monthly sales (transformed – information)

```{nomnoml, fig.width=10, fig.height=3}
#stroke: black
#direction: right
#align: center
[Data]->[Transformation Process]
[Transformation Process]->[Information]
```

---

# Value of Information

- **Goals**: Helps decision makers achieve organisational goals
- **Performance**: Valuable information helps people and organisations perform
- **Accuracy**: Inaccurate/Incomplete information leads to Poor Decisions and can result in High Cost for the organisation 

--

### Data Analytics

- The science of using data to build models that lead to better decisions that in turn add value to individuals, companies and institutions
- The analysis of data, typically large sets of data, by the use of mathematics, statistics, and computer software

```{r}
#| fig.cap: "Data analytics provides an integrated view of business performance."
DiagrammeR::grViz("
  digraph {
    'Business performance results' -> 'What happened?' [dir = both]
    'Business performance results' -> 'Why did it happen?' [dir = both]
    'Business performance results' -> 'What do we want to happen?' [dir = both]
  }", width = 800, height = 150)
```

# Styles of Data Analytics

It uses a combination of historical information about past transactions or events and reference data about, for example, customers or products, to enable a wide variety of analyses and decision support techniques.

- **Standard Reports:** Preformatted information for predefined backward-looking analysis. 

- **Academic Reports:** Application of research methods to business information  using descriptive and inferential statistics.

- **Dashboards:** Business performance metrics using specific variables presented in a tabular or graphical format.

- **Alerts:** Communication to designated business people when a key business variable is outside a predefined performance standard or range.

- **Predictive Analytics:** Application of historical business information to predict future the performance and potentially prescribe a favoured course of action.

# Data Analytics and Storytelling

# Role of Data Storytelling
 
> **Stories** are how we translate core, essential **content**<br>to different **forms**<br>for specific **audiences**.
 
--
 
### Purpose of stories:
 
Visual communication plays an important role in a visual analytics process. No matter how advanced and sophisticated data visualisation techniques are used, if we failed to tell a compelling story by using the data visualisation designed, all the hard work and efforts will be wasted.
 
--
 
### Motivation:
 
.pull-left[
**Exploratory analysis**: 
- exploring and understanding the data, conducting the analysis
]
 
.pull-right[
**Explanatory analysis**: 
- explaining your findings from your analysis in a coherent narrative that leads to a call to action
]
 
---
 
# Build your Story
 
> When adding texts or visualisations, ask yourself: "Does this element support the point I want to make about the data?"
 
--
 
### Guiding Your Viewer 
 
Another way we can guide people through our visualization is by using **annotations**, which can be very helpful in guiding someone through our figure. However, think about only labelling the data that matters.
 
--
 
### Use your titles/captions!
 
- Titles can guide people to the point of your figure
- Primes people to know what to look for
- "If there is a conclusion you want your audience to reach, state it in words"
