# Previoulsy, We have seen...

...how to create advanced visualisations like maps and times series charts.

# Design Strategy

Creating an prefect Tableau dashboard is easy if you follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Basic Figures

Create many figures that can be used to support your story but leave them with all default parameters

#### Step 2: Basic Dashboard

Use the most relevant figures in a basic dashboard without taking care of its design but including all the relevant elements (title, text, pictures)

#### Step 3: Figure Improvement

Go back to the worksheet each figure included in the dashboard and customise them: Colour, size, shapes, title, captions, axes, and interactions

#### Step 4: Dashboard Improvement

Go back to the dashboard and customise it: Background, colours, fonts, layout and actions
