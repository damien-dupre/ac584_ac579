The question of "women and children first" versus "every man for himself" during the Titanic catastrophe is a complex and ethically charged one. The sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912 is one of the most well-known maritime disasters in history, and it raised profound moral and ethical questions about human behavior in life-threatening situations. Let's explore with data.

The survival ratio between males and females on the Titanic varies depending on the passenger class and the location on the ship. The data available from the disaster indicate a significant disparity in survival rates. Below are some general statistics:

    Overall Survival Rate:
        Overall, 74% of women on board the Titanic survived, compared to only 19% of men.
        This significant difference in survival rates can be attributed to the "women and children first" policy that was followed during the evacuation.

    First-Class Passengers:
        Among first-class passengers, 97% of women survived, while 34% of men survived.
        The survival rate for both genders in the first class was relatively high compared to the lower classes.

    Second-Class Passengers:
        In the second class, 86% of women survived, whereas 14% of men survived.
        Second-class women had a significantly higher survival rate compared to second-class men.

    Third-Class Passengers:
        Among third-class passengers, 46% of women survived, but only 16% of men survived.
        While the survival rate for both genders was lower in the third class, women still fared better than men.

The "women and children first" policy was not a formal rule but rather an unwritten code of conduct. As a result, there were some instances of men disguising themselves as women to secure a spot on lifeboats, and there were also women who chose to stay with their families rather than leaving on lifeboats.

In summary, the data on survival rates clearly show that, during the Titanic disaster, women had significantly higher survival rates than men, supporting the idea that the principle of "women and children first" was followed to a large extent.

It is important to note that the sinking of the Titanic was a chaotic and terrifying event, and the actions of individuals on board were influenced by a variety of factors, including their personal beliefs, social norms of the time, and the circumstances of the disaster. Some passengers adhered to the "women and children first" tradition, while others prioritized their own survival.

In hindsight, judging the actions of individuals during the Titanic disaster is a complex matter. The tragedy sparked ongoing debate about human behavior in extreme situations and continues to be a topic of discussion in the context of ethics, chivalry, and societal expectations. Ultimately, how people behave in such situations is a complex interplay of individual morality, societal norms, and the circumstances of the disaster itself.
